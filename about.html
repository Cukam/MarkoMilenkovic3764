<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p> I am a graffiti artist from Serbia. I live in Nis, the largest city in the south of the country.<br> I started drawing graffiti around 2010. In the beginning, it was not serious  and pointless painting. <br>I had a big break in painting graffiti during school.<br> Three years ago, in 2018, I started painting graffiti again, but much more seriously than in all previous years. I like to paint graffiti on apartment buildings that do not have a decorated facade. </p>
